# TB-Detection
The Tuberculosis (TB) Detection project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately detect TB from chest X-ray images. The project incorporates data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data.
